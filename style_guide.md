# Special Minds Writing Style Guide

This guide defines the writing standards, terminology, and style conventions for professional documentation at Special Minds.

---

<key_phrases>
**Essential phrases to preserve and use consistently:**

These phrases represent our professional voice and should be maintained in documentation:

- **"vi oplever"** - Used when describing observations about student behavior or challenges. This phrasing emphasizes empirical observation and professional assessment.

- **"eksekutive funktioner"** - Executive functions. Professional terminology for cognitive processes including planning, organization, and self-regulation.

- **"initieringsevne"** - Ability to initiate tasks. Key concept in describing student capabilities.

- **"fleksibilitet"** - Flexibility in thinking and behavior. Important dimension of executive functioning.

- **"monitorering"** - Self-monitoring ability. Critical skill for independent learning.

**Usage principle:** These phrases should not be "simplified" or varied for stylistic reasons. Consistency in professional terminology builds clarity and credibility.
</key_phrases>

<terminology>
**Company-specific terms and their correct usage:**

### Student References
- **Preferred:** Use placeholder format `{elev_navn}` for student names in templates
- **Avoid:** Inconsistent formats like `{elev navn}` (space instead of underscore)
- **Rationale:** Consistent placeholder formatting ensures templates process correctly

### Professional Language
- **"elev"** (student) - Use for individual learners
- **"grundlæggende forudsætninger"** - Fundamental prerequisites/conditions
- **"udfordringer"** - Challenges (preferred over "problemer" which sounds more negative)
- **"har brug for hjælp til"** - Needs help with (supportive framing)

### Educational Context Terms
- **"undervisning"** - Teaching/instruction
- **"deltage i undervisning"** - Participate in teaching/class
- **"mindes om"** - Reminded about (gentle, supportive phrasing)

**Tone principle:** Use supportive, strength-based language that acknowledges challenges while emphasizing growth and support.
</terminology>

<style_examples>
**Example 1: Student Evaluation Report**

This example demonstrates the professional tone, key phrase usage, and structural approach:

```
{elev_navn} grundlæggende forudsætninger bevirker, at han har udfordringer med de eksekutive funktioner. Vi oplever,
at {elev_navn} har en nedsat initieringsevne, fleksibilitet samt evne til monitorering. Vi oplever at {elev_navn} har brug for
hjælp til initiering. Han skal oftest huskes på hvornår han skal deltage i undervisning, og nogle gange gerne mindes
om det 10 og 5 minutter før undervisningen går i gang.
```

**What makes this effective:**
- Uses professional terminology appropriately ("eksekutive funktioner", "initieringsevne")
- Consistent placeholder formatting (`{elev_navn}`)
- Supportive framing ("har brug for hjælp til" rather than deficit language)
- Specific, actionable details (10 and 5 minute reminders)
- Observation-based language ("vi oplever")

**What could be improved in similar texts:**
- Repetition of "vi oplever" could be reduced if it appears more than 2-3 times in short passages
- Ensure consistent spacing and formatting throughout
- Consider varying sentence structure for readability while maintaining professional tone
</style_examples>

<formatting_rules>
**Placeholder Variables:**
- **Standard format:** `{variable_navn}` (lowercase with underscore separators)
- **Examples:** `{elev_navn}`, `{dato}`, `{skole_navn}`
- **Rule:** Always use underscore, never space or hyphen

**Spacing and Punctuation:**
- Single space after periods
- No space before commas, single space after
- Consistent use of Danish quotation marks: »text« or "text"

**Document Structure:**
- Use clear paragraph breaks
- Avoid walls of text - break into logical units
- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items
- Use numbered lists only when sequence matters
</formatting_rules>

<grammar_preferences>
**Danish Language Conventions:**

### Comma Usage
- Follow Danish comma rules (not English)
- Use commas before subordinate clauses introduced by: at, når, hvis, fordi, selvom
- Example: "Vi oplever, at {elev_navn} har udfordringer..."

### Active vs Passive Voice
- **Prefer active voice** when describing actions and interventions
- **Passive voice acceptable** when focus is on the student/outcome rather than the actor
- Example (active): "Vi giver {elev_navn} støtte til..."
- Example (passive): "{elev_navn} skal huskes på..." (acceptable - focus on student need)

### Sentence Structure
- Vary sentence length for readability
- Avoid overly complex nested clauses
- Keep subject and verb close together when possible

### Verb Tense
- **Present tense** for current observations and ongoing situations
- **Past tense** for specific completed events
- **Future tense** for planned interventions

<writing_principles>
**Core Principles:**

1. **Strength-Based Language**
   - Frame challenges in context of support needs, not deficits
   - Use "har brug for støtte til" rather than "kan ikke"
   - Acknowledge capabilities alongside challenges

2. **Specificity and Evidence**
   - Provide concrete examples and observations
   - Use "vi oplever" to ground statements in empirical observation
   - Include actionable details (e.g., "10 og 5 minutter før")

3. **Professional Consistency**
   - Maintain consistent use of professional terminology
   - Avoid casual language in formal documentation
   - Use established key phrases appropriately

4. **Clarity and Accessibility**
   - Write for multiple audiences (educators, parents, administrators)
   - Balance professional language with readability
   - Explain technical terms when first introduced in a document

5. **Cultural and Linguistic Respect**
   - Follow Danish language conventions
   - Use appropriate formality levels for context
   - Respect student dignity in all descriptions

<correction_guidelines>
**When analyzing and correcting text:**

### Always Preserve
- Key phrases: "vi oplever", "eksekutive funktioner", "initieringsevne", "fleksibilitet", "monitorering"
- Professional terminology specific to educational/psychological assessment
- Placeholder formatting: `{elev_navn}` style
- Supportive, strength-based framing

### Consider Improving
- Inconsistent placeholder formats (standardize to `{variable_navn}`)
- Excessive repetition of phrases (especially "vi oplever" if used >3 times in short passage)
- Comma placement not following Danish conventions
- Sentence structure that impedes clarity
- Missing specificity or concrete examples
- Overly casual or overly formal language (aim for professional-yet-accessible)

### Grammar Focus Areas
- Danish comma rules in subordinate clauses
- Subject-verb agreement
- Correct use of Danish special characters (æ, ø, å)
- Consistent verb tense within sections

### Style Focus Areas
- Paragraph length and structure
- Sentence variety
- Logical flow and transitions
- Balance of professional terminology and accessibility

2. Retrieve the most applicable guidelines from this document
3. Inject retrieved guidelines into the AI prompt using structured XML tags
4. Apply guidelines during text correction and analysis

**For users:** You can expand this guide by adding new sections, terminology, or examples. The system will automatically rebuild its index when this file is modified.

**Sections are designed for modular retrieval** - each section can be retrieved independently based on relevance to the analyzed text.
